### EDA-ML

The analysis has been carried out in Python. Dataset selected for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and prediction is ‘DimCustomer’ in combination with ‘DimGeography’. 

This study uses Logistics Regression for binary classification. After combining the ‘DimCustomer’ table with ‘DimGeography’ table, EDA is done to find only relevant features which can have an impact on target feature (HouseOwnerFlag).

After cleansing and sorting a dataset, perform pre-processing on it. All categorical characteristics undergo pre-processing to turn them into a more suitable kind.

After pre-processing, the dataset is split into training and testing data for the machine learning model. 80% of the data is used to train the model while 20 percent is used for testing the results.

Model accuracy at prediction of accurate results is at 78 % (77.7387).
